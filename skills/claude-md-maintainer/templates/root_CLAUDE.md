# THIS IS CLAUDE.md - PROJECT MEMORY

**STOP. READ THIS FIRST.**

This file is for **Claude Code**. It is **not** user documentation. It is **not** a README.

| File | Purpose | Audience |
|------|---------|----------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Claude Code project memory: workflows, scripts, conventions | Claude |
| **README.md** | User-facing documentation: usage, installation, API | Humans |

**Update this file when:** build/test/release workflows, scripts, CI, or conventions change.

**Keep it lean.** Every line loads into context.
